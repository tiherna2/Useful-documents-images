## Variables
| PICO   |      PICO Proposed  | Example |    
|----------|-------------|-------------|
| **Population** |  Arizonans | Arizonans |
| **Exposure** |    Being of a certain race/ethnicity   | Hispanic/Latino |
| **Comparison** | right-aligned | White non-Hispanic |
| **Outcome** | right-aligned | Measuring rates of the race/ethnicity receiving SNAP |

## Data Sets
1. SNAP Data, Arizona-specific (by race/ethnicity, household income, household size, head of household occupation)
2. Household income by zipcode


## Research Question and Sub-Questions
1. Is there a gap between those eligible for SNAP and those enrolled in SNAP in Arizona? 
2. If present, what is the magnitude of the gap?
3. Are there disparities between race/ethnicity groups regarding eligibility and enrollment gaps?

## Purpose and Rationale

The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) provides nutrition benefits to eligible individuals and households. Namely, SNAP was designed to reduce food insecurity by providing funds to purchase food items. 

Many studies have found associations between receiving SNAP and reduced food insecurity over their time receiving SNAP benefits. This project seeks to find if there is an eligibilty-enrollment gap initially. Then, the project will review data to see if there are any disparities in the eligibility-enrollment gap between various race/ethnicities. By mapping and comparing eligibility and enrollment data, a better understanding of trends can better inform efforts to increase enrollment.
