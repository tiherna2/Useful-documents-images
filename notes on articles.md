# Topics I want to cover in my Literature Review
1. What is food insecurity (definitions, prevalence in US and AZ)
2. Impact of food insecurity on health, well-being, productivity
3. Ways US try to address it (being Food Assistance/SNAP)
4. Arizona-specific data (incidence, prevalence)
5. Reason/purpose for our research - To improve knowledge of food insecurity and use fo snap to long-term help health outcomes related to food insecurity

## Measuring the Effect of SNAP Participation on Food Security

Mathematica

Tags # characteristics of SNAP recipients; Associations with SNAP and Food Security

* This research also reviews differences in association with snap by household characteristics (1) and income (2) but at the national level
* Key findings and research implications

Notes
1. States purpose of SNAP - executive summary
2. Food insecirity decreases as time receiving SNAP increases (o months +): "six-month households were less likely than new-entrant households to be food insecure or experience very low food security."  (See table 1)
3. Trend from #2 follows in households with children
4. Regression analysis outcomes (Table 2) Same trend as points 2 and 3 (food insecurity decreased with increased time on SNAP)
5. SNAP associations with food security stat significant at any level of income/FPL. AKA SNAP equally impacts food insecurity regardless of income level.

Table 1. Food Insecurity Among SNAP Recipients at various time frames
|    Time (months)     | Cross-sectional  | Longitudinal  | 
| ----------- | ----------- |--------- |
| 0           | 65.5%       |     65.5%   |
| 6           | 58.7%       | 52.8% |
